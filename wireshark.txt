===== DAYTIME =====

1   192.168.64.2    129.6.15.28    TCP   40718 -> 13  [SYN]  Seq=0 Win=64240 Len=0 MSS=1460 .......

[2].
The client uses port number: 40718



[3].
The client needs a port in order to communicate on the network.
A port is needed for sending packets and maintaining a connection 
with other servers.

[5].
[SYN] means synchronizing and is a flag that a client sends over 
to the service to initiate the tcp handshake.

[ACK] mean acknowledgement and is a flag that acknowledges that 
a message or series of packets have been recieved.


[6].
The daytime server initiates the closing of the TCP connection 
and it is determined by the [FIN, ACK] flag. This indicates that a 
termination is being signled and so the next frame, we as the source 
also give a [FIN, ACK] flag to indicate OK we recieved the data and 
you can terminate/end the connection.


===== HTTP =====


[1].

8 TCP connections were opened and we can tell by looking at the 
protocol column after we add the filter to be tcp.flags.syn==1. 
This tell the filter to only filter to the tcp flags that 
synchrized, which I explained above, meaning that a request has been made.

Your homepage was requested in the 4th frame after the tcp handshake 
specifically, as follows: 

17    192.168.64.2    172.233.221.124    HTTP    GET /index.html HTTP/1.1


[3].

Your photograph from colorado was requested in the 8th frame:

23    192.168.64.2    172.233.221.124    HTTP    GET /jeff-square-colorado.jpg HTTP/1.1





===== QUESTIONS =====

Does a connection only becomes successful after the client and server have sent 
each other a TCP [SYN] and then the server sends an acknowledgement? 
Is that the meaning of the TCP 3 way handshake?
